## Features

- Fetches detailed data for top 1500 cryptocurrencies (configurable)
- Implements rate limiting and retry mechanisms
- Saves progress for resume capability
- Generates unique IDs for each coin
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Stores data in JSON format
- Supports multiple blockchain platforms

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

```bash
git clone 

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd crypto-scraper
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the script using Node.js:
```bash
node coins.cjs
```

The script will:
1. Fetch data for the top 1500 cryptocurrencies (6 pages of 250 coins each) able to modify the number of coins per page
2. Save progress automatically after each coin
3. Generate a `customCoinData.json` file with the results

## Data Collection

The crawler collects the following data for each cryptocurrency:

### Basic Information
- Name and symbol

- Rank and scores (CoinGecko rank, developer score, etc.)
- Launch date and genesis information

### Market Data

- Supply information (circulating, total, max)
- High/low prices
- Market cap changes

### Social Media Links
- Reddit
- Telegram
- Twitter
- Instagram
- YouTube
- Discord

### Technical Details
- Blockchain platforms and addresses
- Explorer links
- Website URLs
- Platform-specific addresses

## Rate Limiting

The script implements several measures to respect CoinGecko's API rate limits:
- 15-second delay between individual coin requests
- 30-second delay between page requests
- Exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Maximum 5 retries per request

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling:
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed requests
- Progress saving for resume capability
- Default values for missing data
- Detailed error logging

## Output Format

Data is saved in JSON format with the following structure:
```json
{
  "uniqueId": {
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "price": "50000",
    "rank": "1",
    // ... additional fields
  }
}
```
